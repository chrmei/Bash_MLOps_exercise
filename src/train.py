This script runs the training of an XGBoost model to predict graphics card sales 
from the preprocessed data.

1. It starts by searching for the latest preprocessed CSV file in the 'data/processed/' directory.
2. If a standard model (model.pkl) does not exist, it loads the data, splits it into training and test sets, trains a model on this data, evaluates it, and then saves it as 'model/model.pkl'.
3. If a standard model already exists, it trains a new model on the latest data, evaluates it, and saves the model in the 'model/' folder in the format: model_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.pkl.
4. Performance metrics (RMSE, MAE, R²) are displayed and saved in the log file.
5. Any errors are handled and reported in the logs.

The models are saved in the 'model/' folder with the name 'model.pkl' for the standard model and with a timestamp for later versions.
The model metrics are recorded in the script’s log files.
